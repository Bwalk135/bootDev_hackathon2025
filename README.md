Boot Dev Hackathon Submission: A little application that does some stuff related to the Gym and weightlifting/powerlifting; nothing too fancy though :)

Do you struggle with Gym bar math? Be honest, I do too. This nifty little application will do all the work for you. Simple open it up, head to the Bar Math section and add the weight that you need to check into the buttons. It will let you know the result at the top. You can also convert Lbs to Kg on the home page for most of the world who doesn't do things in Metric Units. Or just hang out and watch Skelly work on his glutes (don't let him know he's a little too boney to have any though). 

You can either download the files here or check out the HTML here: https://bryannawalker.itch.io/help-me-do-gym-math
