Boot Dev Hackathon Submission: A little application that does some stuff related to the Gym and weightlifting/powerlifting; nothing too fancy though :)

As of July 26, 2025 at 11:00pm, this applications simply takes the weightlifting math away from your brain and provides the final output for you. Don't remember what two 45lbs weight are on each side? Don't worry, me either, and this nifty (WIP) will do that math for you.
