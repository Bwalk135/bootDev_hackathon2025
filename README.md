Boot Dev Hackathon 2025 Submission: A little application that does some stuff related to the Gym and weightlifting/powerlifting; nothing too fancy though :)

Do you struggle with Gym bar math? Be honest, I do too. This nifty little application will do all the work for you. Simply open it up, head to the Bar Math section and add the weight that you need to check into the buttons. It will let you know the result at the top. You can also convert Lbs to Kg on the home page for most of the world who doesn't do things in Metric Units. Or just hang out and watch Skelly work on his glutes (don't let him know he's a little too boney to have any though, he's been working really hard). 

You can either download the files here or check out the HTML here: https://bryannawalker.itch.io/help-me-do-gym-math

If you do NOT have Unity installed, you will not be able to access the game via the files so you'll have to view the game using the link above. If you have Unity, you can follow these steps:
  1. Download the Zip file
  2. Extract the Zip
  3. Open the Assets Folder
  4. Open the Scenes Folder
  5. Open the SampleScene
  6. Enjoy :)

The home Page will have Skelly doing his daily squats. You can either watch him or...
  1. Convert a weight from lbs (metric units) to kg by clicking into the text box then hitting the "convert" button. The result will be displayed below the input field.
  2. Or, the main funciton of this application, Gym math. Simply click on "Bar Math" at the bottom then add the weight that you put onto the bar in. Click on any of the buttons to add or remove a weight ranging from 45lbs to 2.5lbs. You can't go below the basic bar which is 45lbs though. The application does all the math for you and adds up both sides of the bar plus the bar itself that way you can focus on hitting your protein goals for the day.
